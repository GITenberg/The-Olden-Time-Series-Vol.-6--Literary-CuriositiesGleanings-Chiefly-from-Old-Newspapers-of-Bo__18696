<p>In "old times" almost all the young ladies upon their marriage were
"amiable" and "agreeable"; at least they are so represented in most of
the announcements. The "maiden aunt" could not speak plainer in writing

<p>The following is a notice of a "distinguished merchant" and "literary"
character of Newburyport, Mass. In the appendix to "Lord" Dexter's great
production&mdash;where all the stops are placed together on the last page,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>so that "people can salt and pepper as they please"&mdash;we find these
lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"All men inquire, but few can tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How thou in Science doth excel!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Timothy Dexter.</span> The subject of the present sketch, according to
his own account, was born in Malden, Massachusetts. "I was
born," says he (in his celebrated work, "A Pickle for the
knowing ones"), "1747, Jan. 22; on this day in the morning, a
great snow storm in the signs of the seventh house; whilst Mars
came forward Jupiter stood by to hold the candle. I was to be a
great man."</p>

<p>Lord Dexter, after having served an apprenticeship to a Leather
dresser, commenced business in Newburyport, where he married a
widow who owned a house and a small piece of land, part of
which, soon after the nuptials, were converted into a shop and
tanyard.</p>

<p>By application to his business his property increased, and the
purchase of a large tract of land near Penobscot, together with
an interest which he bought in the Ohio Company's purchase,
afforded him so much profit, as to induce him to buy up Publick
Securities at forty cents on the pound, which securities soon
after became worth twenty shillings on the pound.</p>

<p>His Lordship at one time shipped a large quantity of <i>warming
pans</i> to the <i>West Indies</i> where they were sold at a great
advance on prime cost, and used for molasses ladles. At another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span>
time, he purchased a large quantity of <i>whalebone</i> for <i>ship's
stays</i>; the article rose in value upon his hands, and he sold it
to great advantage.</p>

<p>Property now was no longer the object of his pursuit; but
popularity became the god of his idolatry. He was charitable to
the poor, gave large donations to religious societies, and
rewarded those who wrote in his praise.</p>

<p>His lordship about this time acquired his peculiar taste for
style and splendour; and to enhance his own importance in the
world, set up an elegant equipage, and at great cost adorned the
front of his house with numerous figures of illustrious
personages.</p>

<p>By his order, a tomb was dug under the summer house in his
garden, during his life; which he mentions in 'A Pickle for the
knowing ones,' in the following ludicrous style:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Heare will lie in box the first Lord in Americake the first
Lord Dexter made by the voice of hampsher state my brave fellows
Affirmed it they give me the titel and so Let it goue for as

and now for sale for seven hundred pounds weight of Dollars by

<p class='right'>TIMOTHY DEXTER."</p>

<p>Lord Dexter believed in transmigration sometimes; at others he
was a deist. He died on the 22d day of Oct. 1806, in the 60th
year of his age.</p>

<p class='right'><i>Salem Observer</i>, Dec. 17, 1825. </p></div>

<p>From what we have heard and read of Mr. Dexter, it is a matter of
surprise to us how such eccentricities could have attracted the
attention they evidently did. It is doubtful if so much folly and
conceit could now interest many people for any length of time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Another Old Almanack.</span> In our last we gave an account of an old
Almanack for the year 1703. Since then we have seen another some
sixteen years older, printed for the year 1687. It was bound in
with an old account book that formerly belonged to the Rev.
Thomas Barnard, a minister of Andover, from 1682 to 1718,&mdash;the
great-grandfather of the Rev. Thomas Barnard, D.D., the first
minister of the North Church in this city, who died Oct. 1,
1814, in the sixty-seventh year of his age, also an ancestor of
Capt. Edward Barnard, of this city. We insert the title page
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>and other extracts therefrom, which we trust will impart the
same interest to our readers as we derived from its perusal.</p>

<p>It is prefaced by the following:</p>

<p>Novemb. 24th, 1686. I have Perused the Copy of an Almanack for
the Ensuing Year, Composed by John Tulley, and find nothing in
it contrary to His Majesties Laws, and therefore Allow it to be
Printed, and Published by Benjamin Harris, Book-Seller in
Boston.</p>

<p class='right'><span class="smcap">Edward Randolph</span>, Secr.</p>

<p>The following is the title:</p>

<p>Tully 1687. An Almanack for the Year of Our Lord MDCLXXXVII.
Being the third after Leap-year, and from the Creation 5636. The
Vulgar Notes of which are Prime 16&mdash;Epact 26&mdash;Circle of the &#9737;
16&mdash;Domin: Letter B. Unto which is annexed a Weather Glass,
whereby the Change of the Weather may be foreseen. Calculated
for and fitted to the Meridian of Boston in New-England, where
the North Pole is elevated 42 gr. 30 m. By John Tulley. Boston,
Printed by S. Green for Benjamin Harris; and are to be Sold at
his Shop, by the Town Pump near the Change. 1687.</p>


<p>Then follows "A Table of Kings," from William the Conqueror,
1066, to James 2d, 1685, closing with the lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now may we look on Monarchy and sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In health and peace long live great J<small>AMES</small> our King.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span></div></div>

<p>And concluding with the "Weather Glass," &amp;c., &amp;c., which follow:</p>

<p><i>Prognostica Georgica</i>: Or the Country-man's Weather-Glass.</p>

<p>Prognosticks of Tempests. The obscuring of the smaller stars is
a certain sign of Tempests approaching, the oft changing of the
Winds is always a forerunner of a storm.</p>

<p>Of Winds. The resounding of the Sea upon the shore, and
murmuring of the Winds in the Woods without apparent Wind, shew
wind to follow; shooting of stars (as they call it) is an usual
sign of wind from that quarter the star came from, Redness of
the Skie in the morning is a token of Winds, or Rain, or both:
if the circles that appear about the Sun, be red and broken,
they portend wind: if thick and dark, Winds, Snow, or Rain: The
like may be said of the Circles about the Moon.</p>

<p>Of Rain. If two Rainbows appear, they are a sign of Rain: If the
Sun or Moon look pale, look for Rain: if a dark Cloud be at
Sun-rising, in which the Sun soon after is hid, it will dissolve
it, and Rain will follow: if the Sun seem greater in the East
than commonly, it is a sign of Rain, if in the West about
Sun-setting there appear a black Cloud, you may expect Rain that
night, or the day following, if in the winter time thick white
Clouds appear in the South-east near the Horizon at Sun rising,
they portend Snow, a day or two after: If black Clouds appear
there, it is a sign of Rain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span></p>

<p>Of Fair Weather. If the Moon look bright and fair, look for Fair
Weather. Also the appearing of one Rainbow after a storm, is a
known sign of Fair Weather. If Mists come down from the Hills,
or descend from the heavens, and settle in the valleys, they
promise fair hot weather: Mists in the Evening shew a fair, hot
day on the morrow: The like when mists rise from the waters in
the evening. Much more might be added, but I would not tire the
reader.</p>

<p>It appears by the following that the first form of government,
under the King, was accepted by the people in 1686.</p>

<p>May 14, 1686. Arrived from England, His Majesty's Commission to
divers worthy Gentlemen, to be a President and Council for the
management of his Majesty's Government here, and accordingly on
the 25th of May, '86, the President and Council being assembled
in Boston, the exemplification of the Judgment against the
Charter of the Late Governour and Company of the
Massachusetts-Bay in N E together with His Majesty's Commission
of Government were publickly read, and received by persons of
all conditions with general Acceptance.</p>

<p>It will appear by the following advertisement that a market was
then first appointed by authority to be kept in Boston.</p>

<p>Advertisement. There is Appointed by Authority a Market to be
kept in Boston, and a Committee is ordered to meet and state the
place, and days, and other circumstances relating to the good
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span>settling thereof: Of which a more particular Account may be
speedily expected.</p>

<p>This Almanack was published only 67 years from the settlement at
Plymouth, and 59 from that of Salem. </p></div>

<p>In the eyes of the old New England people the almanac stood next to the
Bible in importance. Almost the only knowledge we have of many events of
those early days has been obtained from diaries kept in interleaved
almanacs. It is true, important facts are often found recorded in
connection with trifling or quite unimportant matters.</p>

<p>The venerable Dr. Holyoke, of Salem, president of the Massachusetts
Medical Society, who died in March, 1829, at the age of one hundred
years and eight months, wrote a letter, a few months before his death,
in answer to a request that he would furnish some particulars of his
mode of living. Dr. Holyoke was through life noted for being remarkably
temperate in all things. After his death it was reported that some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>physician said (perhaps in fun) that if Dr. H. had not been in the
habit of using intoxicating liquors he might have lived to a <i>good old
age</i>.</p>

<p>We give here a copy of this interesting letter.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class='center'><big><b>Salem.</b></big></p>

<p class='center'>SATURDAY MORNING, AUGUST 1, 1829.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Holyoke.</span> The Medical Society of this District have rendered
an appropriate tribute of respect for the memory of their
venerated associate, the late Dr. <span class="smcap">E.A. Holyoke</span>, by publishing an
elegant little volume, containing a memoir of the deceased,
prepared by a Committee of the Society, and a few of his
writings. We have selected from the latter the following
articles, which will interest the reader. The first is an
account of Dr. Holyoke's habits of life, diet, &amp;c., furnished by
him in a letter to one of his friends; the others are a
historical memorandum and a fragment of the Doctor's poetical
effusions.</p>

<p class='center'><i>To &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; Williamsville, Person County,<br />
North Carolina</i>.</p>

<p class='right'><span class="smcap">Salem</span>, Oct'r&mdash;1828.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I received yours of the 20th ult. on ye 30th, wherein you
wish me to give you some Account of my Mode of Life, &amp;c.&mdash;In
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>answer to which I would first mention that I was providentially
blessed with an excellent Constitution&mdash;that I never injured
this constitution by Intemperance of any kind&mdash;but invigorated
it by constant Exercise, having from my 30th to my 80th Year
walked on foot (in the Practice of my Profession)&mdash;probably as
many as 5 or 6 miles every day, amounting to more than a
<i>million</i><a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> of miles, and tho' sometimes much fatigued, the
next Night's refreshing Sleep, always completely restored me. In
early life, between 20 and 30, I used to ride on Horse back, but
being often pestered by my Horses slipping their Bridles I found
it more convenient to walk.</p>

<p>As to my Diet, having been taught to eat of any thing that was
provided for me, and having always a good Appetite, I am never
anxious about my food, and I do not recollect any thing, that is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>commonly eaten, that does not agree with my Stomach, except
fresh roasted Pork, which tho' very agreeable to my Palate,
almost always disagrees with me; for which however I have a
remedy, in the Spirit of Sal Amoniac. Eight or Ten drops of Aqua
Ammonia pura in a wine glass of Water, gives me relief after
Pork, and indeed after anything else which offends my stomach.
As to the Quantity, I am no great Eater, and I find my appetite
sooner satisfied now than formerly;&mdash;there is one peculiarity in
my Diet which as it may perhaps have contributed to Health I
would mention; I am fond of Fruit, and have this 30 or more
years daily indulged in eating freely of those of the Season, as
Strawberries, Currants, Peaches, Plums, Apples, &amp;c., which in
summer and winter I eat just before Dinner, and seldom at any
other time, and indeed very seldom eat any thing whatever
between meals.&mdash;My Breakfast I vary continually. Coffee, Tea,
Chocolate, with toasted bread and butter, Milk with Bread
toasted in hot weather, but never any meat in my Life&mdash;seldom
the same Breakfast more than 2 or 3 days running. Bread of Flour
makes a large portion of my Food, perhaps near 1-2. After Dinner
I most commonly drink one glass of Wine&mdash;plain boiled rice I am
fond of&mdash;it makes nearly 1-2 of my Dinner perhaps as often as
every other Day&mdash;I rarely eat Pickles or any high seasoned
Food&mdash;Vegetable food of one kind or other makes commonly 2-3 or
3-4 of my nourishment&mdash;the condiments I use are chiefly Mustard,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span>Horse radish and Onions. As to Drinks, I seldom take any but at
meal times and with my Pipe&mdash;in younger Life my most common
draft was Cider, seldom Wine, seldom or never Beer or Ale or
distilled Spirits&mdash;But for the last 40 or 50 years, my most
usual drink has been a Mixture, a little singular indeed, but as
for me it is still palateable and agreeable, I still prefer
it&mdash;The Mixture is this, viz. Good West India Rum 2 Spoonfuls,
Good Cider whether new or old 3 Spoonfuls, of Water 9 or 10
Spoonfuls&mdash;of this Mixture (which I suppose to be about the
strength of common Cider) I drink about 1-2 a Pint with my
Dinner and about the same Quantity with my Pipe after Dinner and
my Pipe in the Evening, never exceeding a Pint the whole Day;
and I desire nothing else except one glass of Wine immediately
after Dinner the whole day. I generally take one Pipe after
Dinner and another in the Evening, and hold a small piece of
pigtail Tobacco in my mouth from Breakfast till near Dinner, and
again in the Afternoon till tea; this has been my practice for
80 years&mdash;I use no Snuff&mdash;I drink tea about sunset and eat with
it a small slice of Bread toasted with Butter&mdash;I never eat any
thing more till Breakfast.</p>

<p>I have not often had any complaint from indigestion, but when I
have, abstinence from Breakfast or Dinner, or both, has usually
removed it; indeed I have several times thrown off serious
Complaints by Abstinence.&mdash;As to Clothing, it is what my Friends
call thin; I never wear Flannel next my Skin tho' often advised
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>to it, and am less liable to take cold, as it is called, than
most people&mdash;a good warm double breasted Waist-Coat and a Cloth
coat answers me for winter, and as the season grows warmer I
gradually conform my Covering to it. As to the Passions, Sir, I
need not tell you that when indulged, they injure the Health;
that a calm, quiet self-possession, and a moderation in our
Expectations and Pursuits, contribute much to our Health, as
well as our happiness, and that Anxiety is injurious to both.</p>

<p>I had a good Set of Teeth, but they failed me gradually, without
Pain, so that by 80 I lost them all.</p>

<p>Thus, Sir, you have, blundering and imperfect as it is, an
answer to your Requests, with my best wishes that it may be of
any service to the Purpose for which it was made&mdash;But must rely
upon it that Nothing I have written be made public in my
Name.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> Wishing you long Life and many happy Days,</p>

<p class='center'>I am Yours, &amp;c.</p>
<p class='right'>E.A. HOLYOKE.</p>

<p>P.S. I forgot to speak of my repose. When I began the practice
of Physick, I was so often call'd up soon after retiring to
Rest, that I found it most convenient to sit to a late Hour, and
thus acquired a Habit of sitting up late, which necessarily
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span>occasioned my lying in bed to a late Hour in the Morning&mdash;till
7 o'cl'k in Summer and 8 in Winter. My Business was fatiguing
and called for ample repose, and I have always taken care to
have a full proportion of Sleep, which I suppose has contributed
to my longevity.</p>

<p class='center'><i>Recollections &amp; Memorandums of Past Events</i>.</p>

<p>The first thing that I entirely remember was the funeral of Aunt
Oulton, which was on July 18, 1732.</p>

<p>The first Aurora Borealis I ever saw, the Northern or rather
Northeast Sky appeared suffused by a dark blood-red colored
vapour, without any variety of different colored rays. I have
never since seen the like. This was about the year 1734.
Northern lights were then a novelty, and excited great wonder
and terror among the vulgar.</p>

<p>In 1737, Square Toed Shoes were going out of fashion; I believe
few or none were worn after 1737. Buckles instead of Shoe
Strings began to be used about the same time, but were not
universal in the country towns till 1740 or 1742. Very broad
brim'd Hats were worn as early as I remember. My father had a
beaver whose Brims were at least 7 inches; which when he left
off, I remember I used to wear in the Garden, or in a shower, by
way of Umbrella. They were all cock'd triangularly. And pulling
them off by way of salutation was invariably the Fashion by all
who had any Breeding.</p>

<p>Boots were never worn except on horseback, or snowy or rainy
weather. They frequently had large broad Tops that reach'd full
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>half way up the Thigh. But Boots did not come into general use
till the close of the revolutionary war.</p>

<p>Funerals were extravagantly expensive. Gold Rings to each of the
Bearers, the Minister, the Physician, &amp;c., were frequently given
when the family could but ill afford it. White gloves in
abundance, burnt wine to the company, &amp;c., &amp;c. This extravagance
occasioned the enacting sumptuary laws, which though they
check'd did not entirely suppress the complaints till the
commencement of the revolutionary war.</p>

<p>In 1749, it was reported the train band list of the town of
Marblehead was equal to that of the town of Salem. The
difference is now very great. I suppose Salem has at least twice
the number of Marblehead.</p>

<p>[1749.]<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> The Houses (in Salem) were generally very ordinary.
The first handsome house was built by Mr. Jno. Turner, then Col.
Pickman, then Mr. J. Cabot, &amp;c.</p>

<p>There was but one ropewalk, and that was on the neck, inside the
gate. But one tavern of any note, and that was an old house at
the corner now occupied by Stearns' brick store. The Houses for
public worship were only the old (first) church&mdash;the eastern
parish&mdash;the secession from the first church&mdash;the Friends'
meeting house, and the Episcopal church.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span></p>
<p>The number of Inhabitants was estimated at between 5 and 6000.</p>

<p>The Commerce of this town was chiefly with Spain and Portugal
and the West Indies, especially with St. Eustatia. The Cod
fishery was carried on with success and advantage. The Schooners
were employed on the fishing banks in the summer, and in the
autumn were laden with Fish, Rum, Molasses, and the produce of
the country, and sent to Virginia and Maryland, and there spent
the winter retailing their cargoes, and in return brought Corn
and Wheat and Tobacco. This Virginia voyage was seldom very
profitable, but as it served to keep the crews together, it was
continued till more advantageous employment offered.</p>

<p>There were a few Chaises kept by gentlemen for their own use,
but it was no easy matter to hire one to go a journey.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Antiquity of Nursery Rhymes.</span>&mdash;Many of these productions have a
very curious history, if it could only be traced. Some of them
probably owe their origin to names distinguished in our
literature; as Oliver Goldsmith, for instance, is believed in
his earlier days to have written such compositions. Dr. E.F.
Rimbault gives us the following particulars as to some
well-known favorites: "Sing a Song of Sixpence," is as old as
the sixteenth century. "Three Blind Mice" is found in a
music-book dated 1609. "The Frog and the Mouse" was licensed in
1580. "Three Children Sliding on the Ice" dates from 1633.
"London Bridge is Broken Down" is of unfathomed antiquity.
"Girls and Boys come out to play" is certainly old as the reign
of Charles II.; as is also "Lucy Locket lost her Pocket," to the
tune of which the American song of "Yankee Doodle" was written.
"Pussy Cat, Pussy Cat, where have you been?" is of the age of
Queen Bess. "Little Jack Horner" is older than the seventeenth
century. "The Old Woman Tossed in a Blanket" is of the reign of
James II., to which monarch it is supposed to allude.</p>

and con&#383;titution. Patrioti&#383;m is the &#383;tronge&#383;t pa&#383;&#383;ion; and I
glory in being a <i>Yankee</i>.&mdash;A <i>Yankee</i> is any man born in
New-England&mdash;and New-England contains the three northern States,
and a certain <i>little, pe&#383;tiferous, p&#383;eudo I&#383;land</i>. My
countrymen generally have the credit of being a good-natured,
p&#383;alm-&#383;inging, religious kind of men, very hone&#383;t, but plaguy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>
hard in their dealings&mdash;in&#383;omuch that a <i>Carolinian</i> or a
<i>Georgian</i> frequently &#383;wear that the very <i>Satan</i> him&#383;elf could
never get to windward of them.</p>

<p>This puts me in mind of a &#383;tory.&mdash;A certain Bo&#383;ton &#383;ea Captain,
of a &#383;loop of 60 tons burthen, coming with a cargo of
New-England rum, &#383;hoes, chee&#383;e, potatoes, and other valuable
commodities, into <i>Broadway</i>, which you mu&#383;t know is a very
<i>narrow</i> pa&#383;&#383;age in the <i>Appomatax</i>, a branch of <i>James River</i>
in <i>Virginia</i>.&mdash;Before I proceed I mu&#383;t acquaint the &#383;erious
reader&mdash;and who is there but mu&#383;t be &#383;erious in reading the
&#383;olemn truths I am about to declare&mdash;that every <i>iota</i> of what I
&#383;hall delineate in the&#383;e &#383;acred depo&#383;itories of facts, is
<span class="smcap">TRUTH</span>.&mdash;&mdash;I am now about to elucidate the p&#383;alm-&#383;inging,
religious character of <i>Yankees</i>, by a <span class="smcap">TRUE STORY</span>, <i>never before
publi&#383;hed</i>.&mdash;&mdash;When our Bo&#383;ton &#383;ea Captain, therefore, came into
Broadway, a Virginian comes a-board of him&mdash;and as he goes down
into the cabbin, had to &#383;toop a little, becau&#383;e the cabbin was
low&mdash;for, as I &#383;aid before, the &#383;loop was 60 tons, although our
religious &#383;ea-captain <i>entered</i> but 40 tons at the Naval-Office:
How&#383;omever he had a re&#383;erve of con&#383;cience, for the Naval-Officer
charged him for <i>light money</i>, when there was not one
light-hou&#383;e in all the ancient dominion.&mdash;But this is nothing to
my &#383;tory.</p>

<p><i>N.B.</i> I mean to give the good-natured reader a whole chapter on
<i>the art of</i> <span class="smcap">Story-telling</span>.</p>

<p>Well, as I was &#383;aying, the Virginian being obliged to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>&#383;toop&mdash;the <i>&#383;tooping</i> cau&#383;ed his head to be bowed down; and
looking down, he &#383;aw a <i>book</i> lying upon the &#383;tarboard
locker.&mdash;Well, &#383;ays he, and what the d&mdash;&mdash;l&mdash;but I think it
expedient to omit the <i>Virginian</i> oath; for this man, not being
a moral man, &#383;wore con&#383;umedly, and did not know a <i>bible</i> by
&#383;ight, but only by <i>hear&#383;ay</i>.&mdash;And Captain, cried the
<i>Virginian</i>, will you &#383;ell this bible of yours: I hear it's a
mighty clever book for children.&mdash;And why not for grown people?
cried the Captain, taking up the <i>book</i>. Why, quoth the
<i>Virginian</i>, becau&#383;e I mean my three boys, who are from 11 to 14
years old, &#383;hall be good <i>&#383;cholards at their larning</i>&mdash;they can
all &#383;ay their letters already, and the younge&#383;t can &#383;pell.&mdash;The
Bo&#383;ton &#383;ea Captain opening the bible found the&#383;e words: "<i>Search
the &#383;criptures</i>;" and without &#383;aying any thing him&#383;elf, pointed
out the pa&#383;&#383;age to the <i>Virginian</i>.&mdash;Pugh! &#383;aid the <i>Virginian</i>,
and walked upon deck.&mdash;Now, to explain this my&#383;tery, you mu&#383;t
know the Yankee &#383;ea Captain &#383;hewed him the pa&#383;&#383;age to denote
that he would &#383;ooner &#383;ell his &#383;oul to the d&mdash;&mdash;l, than his
bible to a <i>Virginian</i>;&mdash;and the <i>Virginian</i> &#383;aid pugh! and
walked upon deck, becau&#383;e he could not read. </p></div>

<p>What Mr. Welby, an English gentleman, saw when he was in the United
States in 1821. A very flattering picture of the West.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class='center'><big><b>More Travellers' Stories.</b></big></p>

<p class='center'><i>From the National Gazette</i>.</p>

<p>A new book of Travels in America has been recently issued in
London which rivals the volumes of our old friends Weld, Ashe,
Fearon, &amp;c. It is entitled "A Visit to North America and the
English Settlements in Illinois, with a winter residence in
Philadelphia; solely to ascertain the actual prosperity of the
Emigrating Agriculturist, Mechanic, and Commercial
Speculator"&mdash;by Adlard Welby, <i>Esquire</i>, of South Rauceby,
Lincolnshire. This esquire has said enough, should he be
believed, to settle ultimately the point of the truth or
falsehood of Godwin's notable doctrine, that we owe the increase
of our numbers chiefly to emigration. No sane European would
venture among us after having read Mr. Welby's book. He
discovered that, in Philadelphia, living was <i>very dear</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>comfort <i>very uncommon</i>, and good manners still more rare.
Throughout his journey he found in the taverns "a system of
impertinence, rudeness, rascality, and filth, rendered more
intolerable by an antipathy to the English, in the brutal
manifestation of which most of the Colonel, Doctor, and Squire,
keepers of the taverns, were pleased to indulge." When he asked
an hostler to call him early in the morning, he was answered
that&mdash;he might call himself and be d&mdash;&mdash;d. In the Western
country he found no symptoms of hospitality&mdash;witnessed only
idleness and licentiousness, and experienced every where brutal
rudeness and unbounded extortion. The western people usually
combine in cheating all travellers, and sometimes "<i>rifle</i>,"
that is <i>shoot</i> residents among them who do not choose to
descend to their own level. In Illinois "a party proposed to
each other <i>coolly</i> to go and shoot neighbour *****, who had
behaved ill to them sundry times; it was agreed upon; they went
to his field, found the old man at plough, and, with unerring
aim, laid him dead." And Mr. Welby adds that the country would
be desirable to live in, did not the folks <i>shoot</i> each other
thus, and were they not half savages. The <i>shooting</i> case
reminds us of a traveller's story which we heard at a dinner
table abroad. A gentleman and esquire of strict veracity, like
Mr. Welby, related, in order to shew how common was the calamity
of the <i>coup de soleil</i>, or stroke of the sun, in the Island of
<span class="smcap">Java</span>, that sitting once in the house of an opulent merchant of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>Batavia, drinking a <i>cool</i> glass of Madeira after dinner, with
the merchant's wife in the room, the lady was, in the twinkling
of an eye, <i>reduced to a heap of ashes</i> by a <i>coup de soleil</i>;
when the husband observed to his guest, "don't be alarmed&mdash;we
are accustomed to this;" then rang the bell with great
composure, and on the appearance of the servant, <i>coolly</i>
said&mdash;"Boy&mdash;sweep your mistress out, and <i>bring us clean
glasses</i>."</p>

<p>In the neighborhood of Mr. Birbeck's settlement in Illinois, Mr.
Welby could obtain neither eggs, milk, sugar, salt, nor water;
and when he and his party sent a request to Mr. Birbeck for some
water, the answer returned was, he made it a general rule to
refuse every one. Mr. Birbeck is represented as having deceived
and disappointed most of the English who were lured to his
settlement by his "Journal." Mr. W. could discover none of "the
snug cottages, with adjoining piggeries, cowsteads, gardens and
orchards," which Mr. B. had introduced into his canvass. He
found nothing but the primitive log building, that served the
whole family&mdash;"for parlour, for kitchen, and hall." "The strange
heterogeneous mixture of characters," says Mr. W. "which are
collected here by the magic pen of Morris Birbeck, is truly
ludicrous. Among many others, a couple now attend to the store
at Albion who lately lived in a dashing style in London, not far
from Bond-street; the lady brought over her white satin shoes
and gay dresses, rich carpets, and everything but what in such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>
a place she would require&mdash;yet I have understood that they have
accommodated themselves to their new situations, hand out the
plums, sugar, whiskey, &amp;c., with tolerable grace, and at least
'do not seem to mind it.'"</p>

<p>In one of the principal literary journals of London, Mr. Welby's
book is recommended as "carrying on its front the stamp of plain
dealing, <i>truth</i> and candor, and entitled, from internal
evidence, to the highest authority amid the conflicting
statements and opinions respecting emigration to America." The
reviewer adds:&mdash;"From a country so destitute of moral beauty as
the author depicts it, so disgusting in its human externals, and
so low in the scale, not merely of refinement, but of good
principles, we are happy to withdraw." As Mr. Welby spent a
winter in Philadelphia, and had acquaintance here, it is
probable that such of the latter as have not seen his book will
be pleased to know the complexion of its contents.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p>In the "Essex Register" of July 18, 1833, may be found the following
notice of two well-known American authors:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Discourse on Genius.</span> The Richmond Compiler speaks in terms of
great praise of a discourse delivered recently in Richmond,
before a Young Men's Society, by Joseph Hulbert Nicholas. A
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span>number of extracts are also given in the Compiler, as specimens
of the performance, from which we take the following notices of
two of our fellow-townsmen.&mdash;<i>Boston Courier</i>.</p>

<p>Of Charles Sprague, of Massachusetts, no language can be spoken
but that of unqualified praise. Forsaking the modern school of
writing, he is contented with being simple and natural.
Sublimity, tenderness, wit, elegance, and beneficial satire
characterise his muse.&mdash;The only complaint I have ever heard
made of him is that <i>he does not write more</i>.</p>

<p>Of Nathaniel Parker Willis, a native of Massachusetts, and a
fellow-student with myself at Yale College, I come now to speak.
Of him I shall speak familiarly, as of an intimate friend; and
impartially and justly, as one who wishes him well. Willis, I
venture to pronounce the most remarkable genius our country has
yet produced. I do not call him remarkable merely for his
unusual precocity of song, but remarkable for the possession of
that rare genius, which by any man, young or old, in our land, I
do not think has ever been displayed. Nature has done wonderful
things for him; but alas! he has thus far done but little for
himself. The great pieces he has sometimes given us have cost
him but little effort, and he has thrown out his productions, in
prose as well as poetry, with a profusion and a variety that
seem miraculous; and yet, of all our bards, he has met with the
most severe and merciless censures. In some measure he has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>deserved the treatment. In College he would not condescend to
study, and charity only for his high genius enabled him to gain
a degree. Besides, he gained his first and best reputation by
pieces founded upon scriptural subjects, and he stood committed
to the world as a <i>religious</i> man. Many who had never seen aught
of him but his productions, and had formed the loftiest estimate
of his personal character from the pure tendency of his
effusions, were astonished and grieved when introduced to the
author.&mdash;His head made giddy by the praises of young and old, he
forgot himself, and possessing most shrewd good sense, he would
talk the reverse. He became fantastic in apparel, as he did
likewise in his style of writing; made himself too common, and
almost broke a pious father's heart by deserting the altar of
that divine Jesus upon whose Bible he had founded the fairest
fabric of his fame. My friend, of whom I so sternly speak, is
now in Italy; and should these remarks, per chance, ever meet
his eye, I beseech him by our past friendship, by our walks "by
moon or glittering star-light," through the Eden groves and
avenues of New-Haven, by the love he bears to his parents, and
above all, by the love he bears that Saviour, upon whose image
and the scenes of whose mortal pilgrimage he is rapturously
gazing, in the matchless pictures of the Italian masters, I
beseech him, when he returns to his native land, to wear no
longer a ridiculous mask, but to appear in his own native
strength, dignity, and surpassing loveliness. </p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span></p>

<p>In the "Salem Observer," March 8, 1834, are to be found the following
references to well-known young ladies of the day. Miss Silsbee is
supposed to be the daughter of the Hon. Nathaniel Silsbee, of Salem,
Massachusetts senator in Congress. She afterwards married Jared Sparks,
the well-known historian, president of Harvard College, etc.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">High Life at Washington.</span> The Washington Correspondent of the
Boston Morning Post, in describing Gov. Cass's soiree, thus
notices some of the young ladies who were present:&mdash;</p>

<p>Miss Keyser of Baltimore, uniting youth and beauty, possesses an
eye as dark as the absence of all light, beaming with a lustre
that eclipses all. I never saw a countenance betoken such
perfect happiness; it was like a star-lit lake, curling its lips
into ripples in some dream of delight, as the west wind salutes
them with its balmy breath and disturbs their placid slumber. I
never before realised Byron's idea of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Music breathing o'er the face;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>till Miss Keyser's brought it home to the business and bosom.</p>

<p>Miss Silsbee, of Salem, with a form of great symmetry, possesses
a countenance not only beautiful, but entirely intellectual&mdash;the
most so of any you have met with either here or elsewhere; it is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span>of the Italian model; and should have basked beneath an Italian
sky. She is very easy, graceful and modest in her deportment,
and dresses 'rich not gaudy;' the cameo necklace that graced her
person was only the foil that set off the diamond.</p>

<p>Miss Harper of Baltimore, with a fine face and form, is
particularly unrivalled for a bust of unrivalled symmetry; it
would furnish a model for a Canova; and reminds me of
Greenough's Medora.</p>

<p>Miss M'Lane of this city, with many separate charms that could
not fail of attraction, unites with them the finest of fine
forms.</p>

<p>And last, not least, the younger Miss Cass possesses the most
perfect <i>Madonna</i> countenance I have ever seen clothed in living
lustre. It was one of the first that attracted my attention when
I entered the saloon, and the last that received my parting
glance when I retired; it seemed to be&mdash;</p>

gay; serious but not sad; devout, yet not a devotee. </p></div>

<p>In the "Salem Gazette" of 1815 is the following curious information
about Scott's novels, which shows how easy it is for people to be
mistaken.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>William Er&#383;kine, E&#383;q. is &#383;aid to be the author of the new and
intere&#383;ting Novel, "<i>Guy Mannering</i>."&mdash;Walter Scott had been
pronounced the author.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Waverly.</span>&mdash;It is not yet decided to whom this very intere&#383;ting
novel belongs. It came into the world with all the advantage
that the name of Walter Scott could give it; but Guy Mannering's
appearance &#383;eems to have di&#383;&#383;olved that connection. An article
in our first page attributes the work to Wm. Er&#383;kine; but in the
la&#383;t North-American Review we read the following:&mdash;"An Engli&#383;h
Magazine &#383;ays, the author of Waverly and Guy Mannering is a
young gentleman of the name of <span class="smcap">Forbes</span>, the &#383;on of a Scotch
baronet." The Review remarks, that the extract in the title page
of the latter, from the <i>Lay of the La&#383;t Min&#383;trel</i>, was a
delicate way of informing the public that they were under a
mi&#383;take in attributing the former to Walter Scott. </p></div>

<p>Samuel Sewall, whose remarkable "Diary" has within a few years been
printed by the Massachusetts Historical Society, appears to have been
the successor of John Foster, who printed the first book ever issued
from the press in Boston,&mdash;namely, "Hubbard's Election Sermon,"&mdash;in
1676. All previous printing in the colony had been executed at
Cambridge. Mr. Hubbard was the minister of Ipswich.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class='center'>SAMUEL SEWALL.</p>

<p>When John Foster (the first who carried on printing in Boston)
died in 1681, the town was without the benefit of the press; but
a continuance of it being thought necessary, <i>Samuel Sewall</i>,
not a printer but a magistrate, and a man much respected, was
selected as a proper person to manage the concerns of it, and as
such was recommended to the general court. In consequence of
this recommendation, the court, in Oct. 1681, gave him liberty
to carry on the business of printing in Boston. The <i>license</i> is
thus recorded: "Samuel Sewall, at the instance of some Friends,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span>with respect to the accommodation of the public, being prevailed
with to undertake the Management of the Printing Press in
Boston, late under the command of Mr. John Foster, deceased,
liberty is accordingly granted to him for the same by this
court, and none may presume to set up any other Press without
the like Liberty first granted."</p>

<p>Sewall became a bookseller.&mdash;Books for himself and others were
printed at the press under his management; as were several acts
and laws, with other works for government. Samuel Green, jun.,
was his printer. In 1682 an order passed the general court for
the treasurer to pay Sewall ten pounds seventeen shillings, for
printing the election sermon, delivered that year by the Rev.
Mr. Torrey.</p>

<p>In 1684, Sewall, by some means, was unable to conduct the press,
and requested permission of the general court to be released
from his engagement. This was granted; the record of his release
is in the words following.</p>

<p>"Samuel Sewall by the providence of God being unable to attend
the press, &amp;c., requested leave to be freed from his obligations
concerning it, which was granted, with thanks for the liberty
then granted."</p>

<p>In 1684, and for several subsequent years, the loss of the
charter occasioned great confusion and disorder in the political
concerns of the colony. Soon after Sewall resigned his office as
conductor of the press in Boston, he went to England, and he
returned in 1692. He was undoubtedly the same Samuel Sewall
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span>who, when a new charter was granted by king William, was for
many years one of the council for the province, and who, in
1692, was appointed one of the Judges of the Superior Court; in
1715 Judge of Probate; and in 1718, Chief Justice of
Massachusetts. He died Jan. 1, 1729, aged 78 years.&mdash;<i>Boston

<p>Knowledge of natural history at the Isles of Shoals in the early part of
the last century.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">A Century Ago.</span> The N. York Gazette relates that when Rev. Mr.
Tuck, in the early part of the last century, was ordained
minister of Star Island, one of a cluster called the Isles of
Shoals, his parish offered him, beside the usual parsonage
house, a quintal of fish each family, but no money, as a salary.
It is well known that the fish cured at these islands are called
dun fish, and have the highest reputation for excellence
wherever known. They are caught in the depth of winter, and are
fit for market before the hot weather. They derive the name of
<i>dun</i> from the color which they assume. There were at the period
of which we speak, about fifty families in the cluster, giving
him fifty quintals per year. The average price of a dun fish is
about ten dollars, and the worthy pastor always procured a ready
sale for them, thereby realizing his five hundred dollars per
annum. With this stipend he flourished, and brought up a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>family, whom he educated himself, and fitted one of his sons for
entrance into Harvard College. The lad had never been away from
the Shoals till he reached Long wharf on his way to Cambridge.
He had never seen a horse, nor heard a church bell. On landing,
he saw many horses attached to various vehicles; and speaking to
his father, said, "Only see what queer cows they have in Boston!
they are not shaped like ours, and are all without horns." In
passing by the Old South, in Cornhill, the big bell of that
church struck up a peal, the effect of which nearly drove the
young man mad.</p>

<p>What Captain Hall, R.N., thought of a Salem gentleman.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class='center'><i>From Capt. Basil Hall's Travels in America&mdash;just published</i>.</p>

<p>We reached the town of Salem in good time for dinner; and here I
feel half tempted to break through my rule, in order to give
some account of our dinner-party, chiefly, indeed, that I might
have an opportunity of expatiating&mdash;which I could do with
perfect truth and great pleasure&mdash;on the conversation of our
excellent host. For I have rarely, in any country, met a man so
devoid of prejudice, or so willing to take all matters on their
favorable side, and withal, who was so well informed about every
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span>thing in his own and in other countries, or who was more ready
to impart his knowledge to others.</p>

<p>To these agreeable attributes and conversational powers he adds
such a mirthfulness of fancy, and genuine heartiness of
good-humour, to all men, women, and children who have the good
fortune to make his acquaintance, that I should have no
scruple&mdash;if it were not too great a liberty&mdash;in naming him as
the person I have been most pleased with in all my recent
travels.</p>

<p>After dinner, we repaired to the Museum, the rich treasures of
which have been collected exclusively by captains or
supercargoes of vessels out of Salem, who had doubled one or
other of the great southern promontories,&mdash;the Cape, and the
Horn, as they are technically called by seamen. As my eye fell
on numberless carefully cherished objects, which I had often
seen in familiar use on the other side of the globe, my
imagination revelled far and wide into regions I may never live
to see again.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trollope avers that pigs are caressed by the ladies and gentlemen
of New York.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class='center'>"REFUGEE IN AMERICA."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">New-York and Boston.</span> Mrs. Trollope, in her new work, called the
Refugee in America, introduces some queer comparisons between
the manners of the two cities. We quote for example:&mdash;"In
Boston, there are no persons allowed to vote at the elections of
President or Governor of that province but native born yankees;
while at New-York, emigrants are forced from the ships in which
they arrive directly to the hustings, which are kept open the
first two weeks of every month at Mason's lodge, Broadway, where
they are allowed to jostle off the sidewalks the most
respectable inhabitants. If they are reproved for such conduct,
the answer invariably is,&mdash;'Isn't this a land of liberty?' I was
one forenoon myself stopped at the lodge and offered a vote,
with the preliminary question,&mdash;'Are you a Clay or a Jackson
man?' In Boston, a person seen with a segar in his mouth in the
street, is counted a blackguard; but in New-York no gentleman
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg&nbsp;57]</a></span>makes his promenade without one. In Boston, a housekeeper would
be placed at the Sessions dock for suffering the refuse of his
mansion to be thrown into the street; while in N. York he would
be fined $1 if he allowed it to be thrown elsewhere near his
premises. Swine is a Bostonian's bane, and a N. Yorker's
antidote,&mdash;indeed this animal is as much caressed by the ladies
and gentlemen of the latter city, as a lap-dog in London or
Paris. The Governor and his twenty chosen ministers have made it
a capital offence to molest one of these interesting quadrupeds
while roaming the streets!"&mdash;[Oh! what a lying jade!]</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Early Accounts of New-England.</span> The first settlers of New-England
must have been blessed with singular powers of vision. One of
them speaks of lions in Cape Ann: another (Josselyn), who
arrived at Boston in 1663, and resided in this Colony about
eight years, says of our frogs, "some, when they sit upon their
breech, are a foot high, and some as long as a child one year
old." He likewise says "old barley frequently degenerates into
oats" in New-England. </p></div>

<p>"Enthusiasm" is described as a nervous disorder by Dr. Douglass, author
of the Historical Summary.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dr. Douglass's Notice of Salem.</span> In looking over Dr. Douglass'
historical summary, we found the following note on Salem. The
author formerly lived in Boston, and after his removal to
England, published his work in 1749. As he was a physician, he
probably considered himself authorized to broach new theories.
He certainly showed his ingenuity in imputing to our soil a
tendency to produce the diseases of which he makes mention. It
is perhaps fortunate for us that the Doctor did not live in our
day, as he would have found in the excitement which has recently
prevailed here in relation to the Mill Dam, Theatre, &amp;c., new
proofs of the correctness of his hypothesis.</p>

<p>A new way to cure insanity.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class='center'><i>A CURIOUS IDEA</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knowledge</span> is attained with the greate&#383;t difficulty; we have it
not by intuition, but acquire it by many un&#383;ucce&#383;sful trials and
long experience. One gives a hint, and the other improves it;
but prejudice and ignorance too often &#383;tand in the way: "<i>That
cannot be</i>," or "<i>I cannot believe that</i>," has cru&#383;hed many an
u&#383;eful project. How incredible did the recovery of drowned
per&#383;ons appear at fir&#383;t! When the report reached England, that
many abroad had been brought again to life, after laying under
water &#383;ome time, who gave it credit? But experience has &#383;ince
convinced us of its po&#383;&#383;ibility.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, from the great &#383;ucce&#383;s attending the recovery of drowned
per&#383;ons, I would offer a hint to the public, and leave it to be
improved by them, re&#383;pecting the recovery of tho&#383;e who are mad,
and given up as incurable.</p>

<p>When madne&#383;s breaks forth, the fir&#383;t care of the phy&#383;ician is to
reduce and keep his patient low, in order to check the velocity
and whirl of his thoughts; and if po&#383;&#383;ible to procure &#383;leep, by
quieting the internal turbulency. If all his &#383;kill and efforts
fail, &#383;uch a per&#383;on is as much lo&#383;t to &#383;ociety as if he were
dead. Now if &#383;uch an one were plunged into water, and there kept
until he was apparently dead, and was then recovered by the
u&#383;ual methods (and of which recovery we have now a moral
certainty) I am apt to believe we &#383;hould behold a perfect cure.
There is, I own, &#383;omething &#383;hocking to nature in the experiment;
but if the patient be already lo&#383;t, and dead to &#383;ociety, why
&#383;hould we he&#383;itate a moment to make the trial, when the
probability of &#383;ucceeding is &#383;o flattering?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#9758; We understand the number of deaths in this town the past year

<p>This reminds us of the curious jumble made in the first edition of
Morse's "American Gazetteer," published in Boston in 1797. In the
description of Albany, N.Y., it says: "This city and suburbs, by
enumeration in 1797, contained 1,263 buildings, of which 863 were
dwelling-houses and 6,021 inhabitants. Many of them are in the Gothic
style with the gable end to the street, which custom the first settlers
brought from Holland."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The earliest American writer of whom we have any information was
Peter Bulkley, who was born in England in 1583 and died in 1659
in Massachusetts, and wrote Latin Poetry and Sermons. The

<p>Two different ways of telling a story.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Anecdote</i>. A CLERGYMAN, who in the Matrimonial Lottery had
drawn much wor&#383;e than a <i>blank</i>, and, without the patience of
Socrates, had to encounter the turbulent &#383;pirit of Xantippe, was
interrupted in the middle of a <i>Curtain Lecture</i>, by the arrival
of a pair, reque&#383;ting his a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance to introduce them to the
<i>ble&#383;&#383;ed</i> &#383;tate of Wedlock. The poor Prie&#383;t, actuated at the
moment by his own feelings and particular <i>experience</i>, rather
than a &#383;en&#383;e of canonical duty, opened the book, and began:
"<i>Man, that is born of a Woman, hath but a short time to live,
and is full of trouble, &amp;c., &amp;c.</i>," repeating the <i>burial</i>
&#383;ervice. The a&#383;toni&#383;hed Bridegroom exclaimed, "Sir! Sir! you
mi&#383;take, I came here to be <i>married</i>, not <i>buried</i>!" "Well
(replied the Clergyman), if you in&#383;i&#383;t on it, I am <i>obliged</i> to
marry you&mdash;but believe me, my friend, you had <i>better</i> be
<i>buried</i>."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anecdote.</span> It is doubtless recollected that Dean Swift, though a
great favorite among the ladies, was (no doubt for good and
substantial reasons) nevertheless a bachelor. His opinion of the
married state seemed to be not very much exalted. On one
occasion, he had been called upon to marry a couple, and after
getting them properly arranged, commenced as follows: "Man, that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span>is born of a woman, hath but a short time to live, and is full
of misery," &amp;c. "My dear sir," interrupted the bridegroom, "you
are reading the burial service, instead of the matrimonial."
"Never mind, friend," whispered the Dean, "<i>you had better be
buried than married</i>."</p>

<p><i>Origin of the word</i> <span class="smcap">Dun</span>.&mdash;Dunny, in the provincial dialect of
&#383;everal countries, &#383;ignifies deaf: to dun, then, perhaps may
mean, to deafen with importunate demands. Some derive it from
the word <i>donnez</i>, which &#383;ignifies <i>give</i>; but the true original
meaning of the word owes its birth to one Joe Dun, a famous
bailiff of the town of Lincoln, &#383;o extremely active and &#383;o
dexterous in his bu&#383;ine&#383;s, that it became a proverb, when a man
refu&#383;ed to pay, "Why do you not <i>dun</i> him?" that is, Why do not
you &#383;et <i>Dun</i> to arre&#383;t him?&mdash;Hence it became a cant-word, and
is now as old as &#383;ince the days of Henry VII. Dun was al&#383;o the
general name of hangman, before that of Jack-ketch.</p>

became a bailiff&mdash;This bailiff having &#383;craped &#383;ome money
together, made his &#383;on an attorney, who changed the name of
<i>Dun</i> to <i>Dunning</i>&mdash;the re&#383;t of the genealogy are well known.</p>

ludicrous blunder appeared a few years since in a French
Biographical Dictionary, in which it was stated that the now

<p>The works of John Paul Richter are almost unintelligible to any
but Germans, and even to some of them. A worthy German, just
before Richter's death, edited a complete edition of his works,
in which one particular passage fairly puzzled him. Determined
to have it explained at the source, he went to John Paul himself
and asked him what was the meaning of the mysterious
passage.&mdash;John Paul's reply was very German and characteristic:
"My good friend," said he, "when I wrote that passage, God and I
knew what it meant; it is possible that God knows it still; but
as for me, I have totally forgotten."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Origin of "Foolscap" Paper.</span> It is known that Charles I. of
England, granted numerous monopolies for the support of his
government. Among others was the privilege of manufacturing
paper. The water mark of the finest sort was the royal arms of
England. The consumption of this article was great at this time,
and large fortunes were made by those who had purchased the
exclusive right to vend it. This, among other monopolies, was
set aside by the parliament that brought Charles to the
scaffold, and by way of showing their contempt for the king,
they ordered the royal arms to be taken from the paper, and a
fool, with his cap and bells, to be substituted. It is now more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg&nbsp;84]</a></span>than an hundred and seventy-five years since the fool's cap and
bells were taken from the paper, but still, paper of the size
which the Rump Parliament ordered for the journals bears the
name of the water mark then ordered as an indignity to Charles. </p></div>

<p>Many years ago there was published in Boston a small volume entitled
"Eliza Wharton, the Coquette. By a Lady of Massachusetts." It consisted
of a series of letters said to be founded on fact. A young woman died at
the Bell Tavern in Danvers in 1788, whose gravestone a few years ago
might be seen in the old Danvers (now Peabody) burial-ground. We copy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg&nbsp;90]</a></span>

Danvers; and on Sunday her remains were decently interred. The

in a chai&#383;e, from Watertown, as &#383;he &#383;aid, by a young man whom
&#383;he had engaged for that purpo&#383;e. After &#383;he had alighted, and
taken a trunk with her into the hou&#383;e, the chai&#383;e immediately
drove off. She remained at this inn till her death, in
expectation of the arrival of her hu&#383;band, whom &#383;he expected to
come for her, and appeared anxious at his delay. She was aver&#383;e
to being interrogated concerning her&#383;elf or connexions; and kept
much retired to her chamber, employed in needle-work, writing,
&amp;c. She &#383;aid, however, that &#383;he came from We&#383;tfield, in
Connecticut; that her parents lived in that State; that &#383;he had
been married only a few months; and, that her hu&#383;band's name was
Thomas Walker;&mdash;but always carefully concealed her family name.
Her linen was all marked E.W. About a fortnight before her
death, &#383;he was brought to bed of a lifele&#383;s child. When tho&#383;e
who attended her apprehended her fate, they a&#383;ked her, whether
&#383;he did not wi&#383;h to &#383;ee her friends: She an&#383;wered, that &#383;he was
very de&#383;irous of &#383;eeing them. It was propo&#383;ed that &#383;he &#383;hould
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>&#383;end for them; to which &#383;he objected, hoping in a &#383;hort time to
be able to go to them. From what &#383;he &#383;aid, and from other
circum&#383;tances, it appeared probable to tho&#383;e who attended her,
that &#383;he belonged to &#383;ome country town in Connecticut: Her
conver&#383;ation, her writings and her manners, be&#383;poke the
advantage of a re&#383;pectable family &amp; good education. Her per&#383;on
was agreeable; her deportment, amiable &amp; engaging; and, though
in a &#383;tate of anxiety and &#383;u&#383;pen&#383;e, &#383;he pre&#383;erved a
cheerfulne&#383;s, which &#383;eemed to be not the effect of
in&#383;en&#383;ibility, but of a firm and patient temper. She was
&#383;uppo&#383;ed to be about 35 years old. Copies of letters, of her
writing, dated at Hartford, Springfield, and other places, were
left among her things.&mdash;This account is given by the family in
which &#383;he re&#383;ided; and it is hoped the publication of it will be
a means of her friends' a&#383;certaining her fate. </p></div>

<p>Elizabeth Whitman was the real name of the stranger, and the following
was the inscription on the stone:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This humble &#383;tone, in Memory of Elizabeth Whitman, is in&#383;cribed
by her weeping friends, to whom she endeared her&#383;elf by uncommon
tenderne&#383;s and affection. Endowed with &#383;uperior genius and
acquirements, &#383;he was &#383;till more endeared by humility and
benevolence. Let candour throw a veil over her frailities, for
great was her charity to others.&mdash;She &#383;u&#383;tained the la&#383;t<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg&nbsp;92]</a></span>
painful &#383;cene far from every friend, and exhibited an example of
calm re&#383;ignation. Her departure was on the 25th of July, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
1788, in the 37th year of her age, and the tears of &#383;trangers
watered her grave." </p></div>

<p>Although we recollect seeing the stone some years ago, when the whole
inscription could be read, we visited the spot in April, 1885, and found
only a small portion left,&mdash;a triangular piece, perhaps a foot and a
half high on one side, at the bottom of which we could only make out:
"<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1788, ... the tears of strangers watered her grave." For years,
young persons of a romantic turn of mind have visited the grave and
chipped off small pieces of the freestone for relics. This modern habit
of chipping monumental stones for relics is inexcusable; for it is not
done by ignorant or otherwise lawless persons, but too often by the
educated, who carry their mawkish sentiment to such an extreme as to
deface and sometimes, as in the present case, entirely to ruin a
monument. It is in vain to urge that this was only a stranger's stone,
and that there were none to care. It was all the more an outrage, if
there were no friends to protect it. We are glad to learn that there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg&nbsp;93]</a></span>
were people in the town who did what they could to prevent this
sacrilege.</p>

<p>The following account of this unfortunate lady we take from Hanson's
"History of Danvers:"&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Elizabeth Whitman came from a very respectable family in
Connecticut, where her father was a clergyman. She was possessed
of an ardent poetical temperament, an inordinate love of praise,
and was gifted with the natural endowment of beauty and perfect
grace, while she was accomplished with those refinements which
education can bestow. She was lovely beyond words. But her
natural amiabilities were warped and perverted by reading great
numbers of romances, to the exclusion of almost all other
reading. She formed her idea of men by the exaggerated standards
she saw in the books to which she resorted; and thus when she
looked around her she saw no one who realized her ideal. She
subsequently became intimate with a lawyer, said to be the
Honourable (?) Judge Pierpont Edwards." </p></div>

<p>We next hear of her in Danvers, "where the novelty of her situation,"
continues Hanson, "and her attractive beauty and manners during her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span>short sojourn, caused the entire village and many from the neighboring
towns to attend her funeral. A few weeks after her burial, an unknown
hand erected the gravestone with its eloquent inscription." The stone is
evidently Connecticut sandstone or freestone. Mr. Hanson says of the
volume "Eliza Wharton": "The catchpenny volume of letters which pretend
to give her history has but the figments of the imagination of its
authoress to recommend it."</p>

<p>In these sceptical and agnostic days it may sound a little strange, and
perhaps to some seem quite absurd, that the authorities of Harvard in
1791 felt obliged publicly to deny that Gibbon's History was used as a
text-book at the University. But with the exception perhaps of Tom
Paine, no one in this country had then ventured to assail the literal
interpretation of the Scriptures. Probably the masses of the people
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg&nbsp;97]</a></span>then believed that "Joshua commanded the sun and moon to stand still,
and they obeyed him," that Jonah was swallowed by the whale, and that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In Adam's fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We sinned all."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of course there were exceptions. Therefore, although Gibbon might be an
able writer, it was not safe for young men to study his works, simply
because he had thrown doubt or derision on the Christian miracles. So
when it was reported that a growing liberality of sentiment was being
manifested at Cambridge, and that Gibbon's "Decline and Fall" was to be
used, doubtless no little excitement was roused; and hence the notice.
Before this time doubts concerning many cherished doctrines had been
openly expressed in Boston, Cambridge, Salem, and other places; but
Gibbon had rejected and attacked the whole Christian system as false,
which was a very different matter.</p>

<p>The character of Boston ladies in 1788 is set forth in a letter in the
"Herald of Freedom." The writer gives his observations on the error of
committing children too much to the care of nurses; also makes reference
to teaching the catechism, etc., showing the value of early religious
training. There can be no doubt, we think, that the old methods were in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg&nbsp;99]</a></span>
some respects superior to the present, where in many cases young
children are left to Sunday-school teachers, or, as is often the case,
receive no religious instruction whatever, for fear, as we have often
heard it stated, that they might imbibe some false doctrinal notions at
an age when the deepest impressions are made.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;DEAR PIERRE,</p>

<p><span class='smcap'>No</span> moments glide away more agreeably than tho&#383;e that are
employed in writing to a friend. Happy am I in having frequent
opportunities of exhibiting my &#383;entiments to you, and in return
receiving yours, which palliates in &#383;ome degree, the &#383;orrow our
&#383;eparation occa&#383;ions.&mdash;&mdash;The glaring ab&#383;urdities of the dre&#383;s of
the Bo&#383;ton ladies, occupied the greate&#383;t part of my two la&#383;t
letters. It is but ju&#383;t to &#383;ay &#383;omething of their more laudable
qualities; among&#383;t which, maternal affection de&#383;ervedly claims
precedence.&mdash;The barbarous cu&#383;toms of Europe, in this
particular, have not as yet, and I hope never will be, practi&#383;ed
here. Mothers in this country are &#383;o much attached to their
tender offspring, as to forego all the plea&#383;ures of life (or
rather what are &#383;o termed in Europe) in attending to their
nurture, from which they derive the mo&#383;t &#383;uperlative of all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg&nbsp;100]</a></span>
enjoyments, the heart-felt &#383;atisfaction of having done their
duty to their God and country, in giving robu&#383;t, healthy and
virtuous citizens to the State. The effeminacy of exotic fa&#383;hion
has not at pre&#383;ent extended its pernicious influence &#383;o far as
to induce them to commit the rearing of their children to
mercenary nur&#383;es, who are &#383;ometimes the very dregs of a people;
and who&#383;e vicious habits of taking a drop of the <i>good creature
to drown &#383;orrow</i>, does not promi&#383;e redundancy of health and
vigour to tho&#383;e &#383;uckled by them&mdash;on the contrary, children thus
unnaturally thrown from the arms of a parent into tho&#383;e of a
nur&#383;e, are, almo&#383;t without exception, weak and puny; of
irra&#383;cible tempers and vicious inclinations.&mdash;Nor does the
attention of the ladies expire with the infancy of their
children&mdash;they &#383;till are unwearied in in&#383;tructing them as they
increa&#383;e in years, and a&#383;&#383;iduou&#383;ly endeavour to inculcate
principles of virtue into their young minds at a time when they
are mo&#383;t liable to make a deep impre&#383;&#383;ion&mdash;to accompli&#383;h which,
they never fail to teach them the catechi&#383;m, Lord's prayer, &amp;c.
&amp;c. all of which they oblige them to learn, becau&#383;e they are
perfectly adapted to their comprehen&#383;ion, though many parts of
the catechi&#383;m are altogether incomprehen&#383;ible to mo&#383;t
adults.&mdash;Yet this is not &#383;trange to tho&#383;e who credit the
&#383;criptures; nor does it appear the lea&#383;t incon&#383;i&#383;tent&mdash;for there
it &#383;ays, "God hath cho&#383;en the fooli&#383;h things of this world to
confound the wi&#383;e."&mdash;Therefore, the wonder that children &#383;hould
be able to <i>under&#383;tand</i> that, which is the <i>foundation</i> of all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg&nbsp;101]</a></span>
polemical divinity, vani&#383;hes, when we try it by the touch&#383;tone
of &#383;cripture, which is the criterion by which we ought to
judge.&mdash;When they are thus in&#383;tructed in the rudiments of
virtue, they are &#383;eldom known to apo&#383;tatize; &#383;o that for a
native to become di&#383;&#383;olute and abandoned, is very rare.&mdash;Indeed
they have characters of this kind who emigrate from old
countries; but they &#383;oon find employment for &#383;uch gentry, by
obliging them to labour for the publick good, and "work out
their &#383;alvation by the &#383;weat of their brow."&mdash;Thus the community
is not only delivered from &#383;uch pe&#383;ts, but experience beneficial
effects from their confinement. Knavery, though rarely found in
a native, is not entirely extirpated from the brea&#383;ts of &#383;ome
among them. </p></div>

<p>Remarkable instances of longevity.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Longevity.</span> Mafeus, who wrote the history of the Indies, which
has always been a model of veracity as well as elegant
composition, mentions a native of Bengal, named Numas de Cugna,
who died 1566, at the age of 370. He was a man of great
simplicity and quite illiterate; but of so extensive a memory,
that he was a kind of living chronicle, relating distinctly and
exactly what had happened within his knowledge in the compass of
his life, together with all the circumstances attending it. He
had four new sets of teeth; and the color of his hair and beard
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg&nbsp;102]</a></span>had been very frequently changed from black to grey, and from
grey to black. He asserted that in the course of his life, he
had 700 wives, some of whom had died, and the others he had put
away. The first century of his life passed in idolatry, from
which he was converted to Mahometanism, which he continued to
profess to his death.&mdash;The account is also confirmed by another
Portuguese author, Ferdinand Lopez Casteguedo, who was
historiographer royal.</p>

<p class='center'>DINNER IN "OLD TIMES."</p>

<p>It was an old custom in New England to begin dinner with pudding instead
of soup. Many persons of the last generation may remember, as the writer
distinctly does, seeing old people who still adhered to this practice as
late certainly as from 1850 to 1860. The writer was once at a dinner
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg&nbsp;107]</a></span>where all the family began with soup except the father, a gentleman of
the old school, who had a piece cut from a fresh-baked plum-pudding. He
remarked to the company that such had always been his practice; and so
he excused himself for keeping to his own fashion of dining. The custom
of eating pudding before meat is still very common in Yorkshire,
England. The following extract from a Boston paper of 1819 shows that
John Adams, in 1817, kept up the old style of dinner, which, as might
perhaps be imagined, was not confined to the common people, so called.</p>

<p>In "old times" it was customary to say to children, "Those who eat the
most pudding shall have the most meat."</p>

<p class='center'>PRESIDENT ADAMS.</p>

<p>The ex-president is a handsome old gentleman of eighty-four; his
lady is seventy-six: she has the reputation of superior talents,
and great literary acquirements. I was not perfectly a stranger
here, as a few days previous to this I had received the honor of
an hospitable reception at their mansion. Upon the present
occasion the minister (the day being Sunday) was of the dinner
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg&nbsp;108]</a></span>party. As a table of a "<i>late king</i>" may amuse some of you, take
the following particulars:&mdash;first course, a pudding made of
Indian corn, molasses and butter;&mdash;second, veal, bacon, neck of
mutton, potatoes, cabbages, carrots, and Indian beans; Madeira
wine, of which each drank two glasses. We sat down to dinner at
one o'clock; at two, nearly all went a second time to church.
For tea, we had pound cake, sweet bread and butter, and bread
made of Indian corn and rye, similar to our brown home-made. Tea
was brought from the kitchen, and handed round by a neat white
servant girl.</p>

<p>The establishment of this political patriarch consists of a
house two stories high, containing, I believe, eight rooms; of
two men and three maid servants; three horses and a plain
carriage. How great is the contrast between this individual, a
man of knowledge and information&mdash;without pomp, parade, vitious
and expensive establishments, as compared with the costly
trappings, the depraved characters, and the profligate
expenditure of &mdash;&mdash; House, and &mdash;&mdash;! What a lesson <i>in this</i>
does America teach! There are now in this land no less than
three Cincinnati! </p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Hogs in New York streets.</p>

<p>Yesterday forenoon, while in Broadway, we witnessed another
instance of the impropriety of suffering Hogs to run at large in
our streets. A highly respectable and most worthy young lady,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg&nbsp;109]</a></span>was literally run down by a large Hog that was pursued by a dog.
In her fall, her breast struck the curb stone, and she was
considerably injured. After she had partially recovered, the
gentleman at whose store she had made some purchases, kindly
conveyed her to her father's house in a carriage. The reader may
easily imagine the distressing effect produced on the mind of a
fond parent, at the sight of a darling child, whose pale cheeks
plainly indicated her situation. &#9758; <i>What would not the citizens
of Boston say of their Police, if Hogs were permitted to run

<p>THE Rev. R. Turner, who has publi&#383;hed a book called Cla&#383;&#383;ical
Geography, gives the following account of the cities of
Philadelphia and Newyork. "Philadelphia, (&#383;ays he) is the finest

they have not only carefully examined the works of the

city of Newyork contains five thou&#383;and inhabitants, chiefly of
Dutch extraction." Here is pretty &#383;trong evidence of the

<p>An Engli&#383;h Touri&#383;t, who&#383;e name is not ju&#383;t now recollected, has
publi&#383;hed a volume of his travels through the United States, in
which he &#383;peaks particularly of the orderly manner in which
Elections are conducted in the city of Newyork. "On the
appointed day, &#383;ays he, all the citizens take care to be at home
at a certain hour, at which time the in&#383;pectors of the election
go through the city with ballot boxes in their hands, and call
at every door for votes, whereupon the citizens &#383;tep to their

which are &#383;traightway carried to the City Hall; the votes are
there examined, and thus the election is determined in a few

prince, yet in <i>America</i>, the people tax them&#383;elves, and
<i>therefore cannot tax them&#383;elves beyond their abilities</i>. But

one great error has, I apprehend, entered into the &#383;y&#383;tem of
Revenue and Finance in almo&#383;t all nations, viz. re&#383;tricting the
collection to money. Two or three millions can more ea&#383;ily be

only are collected 40 millions of &#383;acks, of one hundred and
twenty pounds each, equal to 80 million bu&#383;hels; in raw and
wrought &#383;ilk one million pounds. The rest is taken in &#383;alt,
wines, cotton, and other fruits of labour and indu&#383;try, at a
certain ratio per cent. and depo&#383;ited in &#383;tores over all the
empire. The peri&#383;hable commodities are immediately &#383;old, and the

<p>Meaning of the word.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen.</span> How the signification of words alter in the course of
a century. There was a time when all persons in England, below
the rank of an <i>Esquire</i>, were divided into <i>Gentlemen</i>, Yeomen
and <i>Rascals</i>. The former word is now used to signify the
individuals of the first order&mdash;those whom you would take by the
hand in the street, and sup with of an evening. The second term
retains pretty nearly its original meaning. But to make an
application of the latter appellative at this time, would
operate as an invitation to be knocked down. 'Gentlemen,' is
used in opposition among the old chronicles to 'simple man,' and
neither in any very exalted sense. It is on record, that the
French Princess, De La Roche Sur Yon, receiving a sharp reply
from a Knight, to whom she gave the epithet of '<i>Gentilhomme</i>,'
was told by the King, to whom she complained, that she deserved
all she got, for so offending, herself, in the first instance.
The lower people in England were commonly '<i>the
Rascality</i>'&mdash;equivalent to the '<i>Canaille</i>' of the French, or
our own significant <i>Rabble</i> of the present day.</p>

there is an article upon a late work of Mr. Moore's, in which
the writer says, 'Mr. Moore has resided in America, and, we
understand, speaks of the Americans with unbounded dislike and

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
